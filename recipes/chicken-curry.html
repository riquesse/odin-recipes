    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sear the chicken: Heat vegetable oil or ghee in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside;</li>
        <li>Saute the aromatics: In the same skillet, add chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant;</li>
        <li>Add the spices: Stir in curry powder, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder, and cayenne pepper. Cook the spices with the onion mixture for about 1 minute until aromatic;</li>
        <li>Simmer with liquid: Pour in the coconut milk and diced tomatoes with their juices. Stir well to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer;</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken: Return the seared chicken pieces to the skillet, along with any juices that have accumulated. Stir to coat the chicken in the curry sauce. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the skillet, and let the curry simmer gently for about 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the flavors have melded together;</li>
        <li>Adjust seasoning: Taste the curry and adjust the seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed;</li>
        <li>Serve: Once the chicken is cooked through and the curry sauce has thickened slightly, remove the skillet from the heat. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves if desired. Serve the Chicken Curry hot with cooked rice or naan bread;</li>
        <li>Enjoy: Enjoy the delicious flavors of your homemade Chicken Curry!</li>
