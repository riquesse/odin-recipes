    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the <span lang="it">penne</span> pasta and cook according to package instructions until <span lang="it">al dente</span>. Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.
        </li>
        <li>
            Separate the yolks: Carefully crack the eggs and separate the yolks from the whites. Place the yolks in a mixing bowl, and set aside the whites for another use or discard them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare the sauce: While the pasta is cooking, in a mixing bowl, whisk together the yolks and grated cheese until well combined. Season with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the <span lang="it">guanciale</span>: In a skillet over medium heat, cook the diced <span lang="it">guanciale</span> until crispy and golden brown. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine everything: Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the skillet with the cooked <span lang="it">guanciale</span>. Toss everything together until well mixed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the sauce: Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta and toss continuously until the eggs thicken from the heat of the pasta. If the sauce seems too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water a little at a time until desired consistency is reached.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve: Divide the <span lang="it">penne alla carbonara</span> between two plates or bowls. Garnish with freshly ground black pepper, serve immediately and enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Note: It's important to toss the sauce with the hot pasta off the heat to avoid scrambling the eggs. Additionally, if you prefer a saucier texture, you can increase the amount of reserved pasta water added to the sauce. Adjust seasoning to taste before serving.
