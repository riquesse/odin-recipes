        <li>Tomato sauce or pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese, shredded or sliced</li>
        <li>Pepperoni slices</li>
        <li>Olive oil (optional, for brushing the crust)</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning or dried oregano (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
        <li>Crushed red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat your oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your pizza dough recipe or on the packaging of your store-bought dough. Typically, this is around 450-500°F (230-260°C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare the pizza dough: If you're using store-bought dough, remove it from the packaging and let it come to room temperature. If you're making homemade dough, roll it out on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare the pizza crust: Place the rolled-out pizza dough on a pizza stone, baking sheet, or pizza pan lined with parchment paper. If desired, brush the edges of the crust with olive oil and sprinkle with Italian seasoning or dried oregano for extra flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the sauce: Spread a layer of tomato sauce or pizza sauce evenly over the pizza crust, leaving a small border around the edges.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the cheese: Sprinkle shredded or sliced mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce, covering the entire surface of the pizza.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the pepperoni: Place pepperoni slices evenly over the cheese, spacing them out to ensure each slice gets some pepperoni.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the pizza: Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven and bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted, usually around 10-15 minutes depending on your oven and the thickness of your crust.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve and enjoy: Once the pizza is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve hot and enjoy your delicious homemade pepperoni pizza!
